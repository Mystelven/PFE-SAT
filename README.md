#Introduction 

This project has been developed for my Final Project during my last year of Engineering in [Ecole Polytechnique de l'Université de Tours](http://polytech.univ-tours.fr/).

I ask my teachers one year ago to be able to work on this topic during my final project. 

We set up, with [Christophe Lenté](http://www.univ-tours.fr/m-lente-christophe-822.kjsp), the goals of this project.

### Duration of this project : from 01/10/2014 to 12/05/2015.

#Goals of this project

- Study and resolution of the SATisfiability problem.

- Bibliography and researchs about existing solvers.

- Development of meta-heuristic to quickly find a solution (when it exists).

- Benchmarks and setting of these meta-heuristics.

- Add of technics to detect the unsatisfiability.

- Benchmarks and comparaison with the existing solvers.

- Use of polynomial reduction to solve NP-hard problems.
